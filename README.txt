Output of the test cases is stored in "ans.csv".
untitled.fig and untitled.fig gives cost functions with iterations.
cost()--> to find the cost function.
grd()--> gradient descent.
probability()--> to train for given datasets.
test()--> to find the output of the test cases.
sigmoid--> to calc sigmoid and do a part of gradient descent.
